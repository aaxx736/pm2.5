## Overview
This repository contains the code and dataset used for the research paper **"Spatio-Temporal Forecasting of PM2.5 via Spatial-Diffusion guided Encoder-Decoder Architecture"**, which introduces a novel Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture designed to forecast $$PM_{2.5}$$ air pollution levels. The model captures both spatio-temporal correlations and spatial diffusion effects to improve the accuracy of $$PM_{2.5}$$ forecasts.

$$PM_{2.5}$$ refers to fine particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 $$\mu m$$ or less, and elevated levels of $$PM_{2.5}$$ are known to have severe health implications. This work presents a powerful forecasting tool based on an encoder-decoder architecture, enhanced with GNNs to account for spatial diffusion across locations, while leveraging gated recurrent units (GRU) for temporal modeling.
